Hereâ€™s a beginner-friendly version of your explanation:

useEffect is a React Hook that lets you run code when things in your component change, like React states.

You use it like this: useEffect(setup, dependencies);

setup is a function where you put your code, and dependencies is a list of variables that your code depends on.

How it works:

1. The setup function runs the first time your component shows on the page.


2. Whenever the values in the dependencies list change, React will:

Run a cleanup function (if you return one in setup) to handle old data.

Then, run the setup function again with the new data.




Important rules:

You can only use useEffect at the top level of your component, not inside loops or if statements.


Example:
Here's an example that connects to and disconnects from a chat room when a user joins or leaves:


useEffect(() => {
  const connectToChat = () => {
    console.log("Connected to chat room");
  };
  
  const disconnectFromChat = () => {
    console.log("Disconnected from chat room");
  };

  connectToChat(); // Runs when the component mounts

  return () => {
    disconnectFromChat(); // Cleans up when dependencies change or the component unmounts
  };
}, [/* dependencies here */]);
